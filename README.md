# TensorFlow Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focusing on the analysis, preprocessing, and modeling of diabetes and wine datasets.

## Table of Contents

- [Diabetes Data Sets](#diabetes-data-sets)
- [Wine Data Set](#wine-data-set)
- [Embedding + Model](#embedding--model)
- [LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)](#lstm-long-short-term-memory)
- [Data Preprocessing and Model Improvement](#data-preprocessing-and-model-improvement)

## Diabetes Data Sets

### Oversampling

The notebook includes techniques to balance the classes in the diabetes dataset by oversampling.

### Scaling and Transformation

Feature sets are scaled using the `StandardScaler`, and data transformation techniques are applied to create normalized histograms.

### CSV Files and Data Storage

The datasets used in this notebook are stored in a ZIP folder called `datasets.zip`. Ensure to extract the contents before running the notebook.

## Wine Data Set

This section includes the analysis and modeling of a wine dataset.

## Embedding + Model

Here, the notebook demonstrates embedding techniques followed by modeling.

## LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

This section explains the implementation of LSTM networks.

## Data Preprocessing and Model Improvement

The notebook employs various techniques to improve the models:

- **Oversampling**: Balancing class distribution.
- **Feature Scaling**: Using `StandardScaler` to normalize the features.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting data arrays back to data frames and visualizing the data distribution.
